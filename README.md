## Inspiration:
When we first created our team, we wanted to be team _Monkey Business_. With such a silly name, it was a given that we had to make a project _equally_ as silly. What better audience would appreciate us if not K-5 students? 

## What it does:
**BANANZA** is a website that offers 6 simple yet effective mini-games for young students to practice motor, memory, routine-building, and decision-making skills. Game description cards provide the name, description of the game, and a play button that leads the user to an embedded mini-game, which also has the option to go back to the website. 

## How we built it:
We used Figma to prototype the website design. Afterwards, we split up into 2 teams, one on front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while the rest worked on creating the six mini-games used with Scratch and Unity. The Scratch mini-games were embedded into the website. 

## Challenges we ran into:
Translating the Figma design, especially horizontal scrolling and trying to fit images into the container template was difficult for our beginner front-end developers. One of our mini-games ended up being very time consuming and required a lot more work than we expected (scoping issue). The biggest struggle was managing project sharing through GitHub and understanding how branches and commands worked.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Our front-end developers are very proud of the UI Design and being able to code a majority of their idea despite not having much experience. Being able to spit out 6 games in a weekend is also an amazing feat from our freshmen game-devs.

## What we learned:
For our 2 front end developers, we learned how to properly utilize GitHub so that we could work side by side and collaborate. We learned a lot more about the relationship between the markup/scripting languages too. On the game development end, one of our developers learned a lot about the immune system to accurately represent the information and built his knowledge on Unity game development.

## What's next for BANANZA:
With more time to work on development, we hope to enhance the game experience and UX experience for users. Accessibility is also a goal for us and we hope to also make BANANZA IOS compatible for schools that may provide iPads for young students.
